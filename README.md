# Kaleidescape_PIC_10C_Final
----------------------------------------------------------------
Kaleidescape is an interactive game that involves solving word scrambles to advance through the levels in the game. 

Theme:
You wake up in the Kaleidescape.

You look around, there is no one in sight and the world has lost its COLOR!

You find yourself stuck in a room, try to find a way out.

Up ahead, there are several rooms. The farther you get, the more color you will bring back into your life.

(Hint: This room is really easy to escape)

----------------------------------------------------------------
## Instructions and Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------
Each room contains two word scramble puzzles that you must solve to pass to the next. 
The user gets four tries to solve the word. If the user fails to unscramble one word after four tries in one room, they are automatically taken back to the previous room. 
The user can attempt to pass a room as many times as needed, but each time they are taken out of the room (after failing the word scrambles for the associated room), their progress for that room is wiped and they must start at the first word when they return to the room. However, if they pass the room and decide to re-enter the previous room, then their progress will be saved even after leaving the room.

## Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------
Landing page: 
“Start” - Users can start the game from here.
“Rooms” - Users can see an overview of all the rooms here.
“Options” - Users can change audio settings by clicking on/off
“Exit” - Users can exit the game by clicking here.

Start: 
Users will be brought to Room 1. There will be instructions on how users should proceed:

Clicking on the door will lead to the next window (or next room, Room 2):

The computer is the an interactive component. Clicking on the computer will open a dialog that prompts the user to unscramble the first word: 

A scrambled set of letters will appear on the computer screen. Upon entering the correctly scrambled word, users will receive a confirmation message, and “unlock” items (which will appear in the window). The first room has two words to unscramble, thus two items to unlock.

After users solve the two word scrambles, they will be brought to the next “room” -- Room 3 -- where they will need to interact with the window by clicking on the right (hidden) cues related to previous rooms. The cue, when clicked on, will prompt the user to scramble more words, as in the previous room. This process will continue until you reach Room 4. Once you pass Room 4, you’re led to the end page where you could exit the game. 

Rooms:


Users will be able to view of all the rooms (Room 1, 2, 3, and 4) in the game. User can only access rooms that they have already passed; the other rooms remain locked. For instance, passing Room 1 gives you access to Room 1 and Room 2; passing Room 2 gives you access to all previous rooms and the next room (i.e. Room 3), etc. 

Options: 
Users will be able to change audio settings here by turning the music on or off.
